# HAND

A simple dialect of ARM for easy introduction to the syntax.

## Motivation

During my studies at [UoM](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/) I was introducted to and slowly learned ARM assembly over various modules. The learning curve was steep, but I quickly became used to the syntax.
I always wished there was a **modern** "book" or "guide" for learning ARM assembly. So here is my attempt at providing that.

Being devoid of multiple encodings and slightly more obscure instructions means that the rules and syntax of the language can be learned and understood faster that simply being thrown in at the deep-end.
